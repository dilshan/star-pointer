This sensor kit builds around the STM32F103C8 microcontroller, ADXL345 3-axis accelerometer, and HMC5883L 3-axis magnetometer. It communicates with the PC using the inbuilt USB peripheral of the STM32F103C8 microcontroller.

StarPointer is an open-source project. This repository has all the schematics, PCB design files, firmware source codes, and application source codes.

The complete documentation of this project is in the [wiki section](https://github.com/dilshan/star-pointer/wiki) of this repository. The PCB Gerber files and compiled binaries are also available in the [release section](https://github.com/dilshan/star-pointer/releases) of this repository. The PCB of the StarPointer can also [order from the *PCBWay* website](https://www.pcbway.com/project/shareproject/StarPointer_virtual_electronic_finderscope_2c7c17a4.html).
